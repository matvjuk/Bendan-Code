# Bendan-Code 
This is a public version of the private BendanCode repository.
This repository will be where you can download the BendanCode binaries.

BendanCode is an IDE for developing in my own language Vig. For now, only Windows is supported, but in the future, MacOS and Linux are planned, and maybe even mobile platforms.

The Vig compiler is currently being implemented. It will also support translators to popular programming languages, an interpreter with and without byte code, and a JIT compiler. The IDE will also include a linker, assembler, and code editor.

# Install
Binary files will be stored in the bin folder. You can download them to your computer.

You may need some dll files from Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 for work, which are not in the bin folder.

To write code, use the test.vig file, which is located in the same folder with BendanCompiler.exe. To compile, you need to run this executable file.

For assembly and linking, ml64 and Microsoft linker are used. Make sure that you have them installed and the path to them is added to the PATH variable in the command line. They are included with Visual Studio.
